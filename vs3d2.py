vs3d3_v2.0.py — SPX Dealer Terrain (VS3D guide-spec rebuild) (Streamlit POC)
=================================================
Point your streamlit.io app at this file.

CHANGELOG (newest first) — what changed and why, per version
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
v2.1.7 [LIVE-SESSION FIXES — 2026-07-07 first RTH validation]
  • DEFAULTS: Expiries to aggregate 3→1 (0DTE only — the gradient chart is a
    0DTE tool; multi-expiry background was washing out asymptotic structure).
    Price window ±2.5%→±1.5% (comparable zoom to the VS3D reference).
  • Calibrate range / Reset cap moved OUT of the collapsed Terrain expander to
    top-level sidebar — mid-session scale fixes must be one click away.
  • Stale-cap banner: if the live p92 exceeds 3× the fixed cap, the app says so
    (today the field sat saturated for ~90 min before anyone noticed).
  • K* parity band tightened ±3%→±1%: stale-but-uncrossed quotes 160 pts out
    won K* (7330 @ spot 7490). Near-spot parity only.
v2.1.6 [VIX = TVC ONLY] Barchart $VIX fallback REMOVED per user rule — VIX now
  comes exclusively from TradingView TVC:VIX (fetch_vix_live). If the TVC pull
  fails, the gate shows "VIX n/a · TVC feed unavailable" (zero confidence
  effect) instead of silently regressing to a possibly-delayed quote.
v2.1.5 [LIVE VIX] VIX regime gate now sourced from TradingView TVC:VIX (live)
  via the existing tvdatafeed dependency — fetch_vix_live(), last 1-min close,
  sanity band 5–200. Barchart $VIX kept as automatic fallback (its free index
  quote may be delayed; a stale VIX matters most exactly during a spike, when
  the vanna gate should flip). Snapshot stores vix_src ("tvc"/"bc"); the Read
  tab's VIX line shows the source so live validation can confirm which fed it.
  No greek math touched — VIX is regime gate + confidence only.
v2.1.4 [PERF/JIGGLE FIX] Two changes for CPU + screen-shake:
  • Fixed-size chart rendering (use_container_width off, dpi 80). The jiggle was
    Streamlit's resize feedback loop: responsive image ↔ scrollbar ↔ container
    width oscillating on tall pages (Read tab). Fixed-size images end the loop.
  • Live-render signature cache: each tab re-computes ONLY when its snapshot or
    its own controls change; otherwise the cached PNG is shown with zero math.
    Changing the Greek recomputes Terrain alone — Signals/Read stay cached. An
    idle page now does no per-rerun BS-grid work at all (one benign extra render
    right after a cap first seeds).
v2.1.3 [Terrain strike scale] 25-pt price ticks now bright (#9fb0c3, larger) on
  BOTH sides — left on the main field, right beside the profile histogram (VS3D
  style) — plus subtle horizontal gridlines across the field so ridges and walls
  map to strikes at a glance.
v2.1.2 [Read tab glance graphics] Two cheat-sheet panels under the text:
  left = minimal sketch of the current pattern (chop zigzag with range band for
  +γ; expansion curve with trigger dot for −γ, in direction color); right = 'the
  day on one map' drawn with LIVE levels — UPPER/LOWER TEST (walls, amber),
  ANCHOR (PIN, blue; merged label when pin sits on a wall), spot dot, and a lean
  arrow to target (label suppressed when it would collide with a level label).
v2.1.1 [Read tab visual + pin fix] Read card rebuilt: large bold pattern header
  with ▲/▼ in direction color (green bullish / red bearish vs spot), wrapped NEXT
  line, colored gate stack (bull/bear/amber semantics; fixed FLOW-contains-LOW
  substring bug), colored confidence bar. PIN candidates now constrained to ±2.5%
  of spot — deep-wing OI was dragging pin to absurd levels (e.g. 6825 with spot
  7537), corrupting the tension note; same class of fix as flip/K* earlier.
v2.1  [NEW 📖 Read tab — the cheat-sheet as a decision engine] γ environment
  (side of flip + magnitude vs session trailing) × charm lean (empirical Δbook-
  delta/Δt when 2+ snaps, else model charm; hedging-effect: rising book delta =
  dealers SELL = lean down) → one of the four day patterns (chop-up / chop-down /
  bull expansion / bear flush) with structure suggestion and 'buy what price goes
  through, sell what price goes to' strikes. Gates: charm clock, straddle check
  (decaying / flat-repricing / collapsing), VIX regime (now fetched per snapshot),
  fishbone (hard-caps confidence at 25 — SIT OUT), γ-absorption along the path
  (§5.4), negative-γ 'needs a trigger' penalty, pin-vs-charm tension flagged when
  PIN sits against the lean. Confidence 5–95 from the gate stack. Playback key
  'read'. Proxy-honest footer throughout.
v2.0.2 [Weighting made explicit + honest] New Terrain control 'Weighting':
  OI + Volume (default: yesterday's settled book + today's cumulative flow),
  OI (opening book — static all day, §4.5 'respect the opening position'),
  Volume (today's flow — cumulative, resets overnight only, counts round-trips),
  Vol-else-OI (legacy rule; kept, but it under-weights a big-OI strike the moment
  it prints 2 lots — that discontinuity is why it's no longer default).
  Nothing is signed; nothing resets intraday; OI cannot change intraday (OCC
  publishes once daily). Cap seeds/history are per greek+weighting.
v2.0.1 [FIX — controls now apply instantly] PLAYBACK was engaging whenever ANY
  frame was cached, so after the first snapshot every rerun replayed a frozen PNG
  and sidebar changes (Greek, opacity, cap…) did nothing until the next 5-min
  snapshot. Now: replay ONLY while ▶ playing or scrubbed to an older frame;
  paused at the latest frame = LIVE render every rerun (cache overwritten so
  playback stays current). Also: Expiries-to-aggregate default 1→3 (§1.5 whole
  book), cap seeds at 1.2×p98 (less saturation, more gradient), side histogram
  scales to its own shape (no more slab), off-hours banner explains the flat
  pre-market field.
v2.0  [REBUILD to VS3D guide spec — 7 tabs → 2]
  After a word-by-word read of the VS3D Onboarding Guide (all 7 chapters):
  • 🗺 TERRAIN — the Gradient Chart done right. Multi-expiry book (each expiry
    decays on its own clock; 0DTE dominates via asymptotic gamma, §1.5/1.6).
    Greeks: Delta Change (§7.7, new — book_delta(now) − book_delta(P,τ); the
    'path of least resistance', combines gamma+charm), Gamma (model or §2.7
    simulated $5 finite-diff), Charm (hedging-effect polarity: SELL=gold).
    Rendering per §2.4: MANUAL symmetric range with Calibrate-from-trailing
    (a loose day looks loose; no per-frame percentile rescaling), Power
    intensity default 1.0 (near-linear; low power = Dan's 'cartoon setting'
    warning), field opacity default 0.38 BEHIND candles. §1.5 contours: dotted
    zero boundary, RED ridge chains (local maxima through time), BLUE troughs.
    Straddle bounds (§5.3), side profile histogram (right edge), Vol Adjust
    0/+1%, Pinak dealer-levels overlay.
  • 🧭 SIGNALS — the §5.1 daily workflow as one panel: straddle now/open +
    decaying gate (snake-oil check), spot±straddle range, fishbone verdict,
    regime vs trailing, timing window, CHARM GATE (decaying AND 1:30–3pm),
    gamma absorption to each bound in e-mini equiv (§5.4 'profile consumes
    itself') with path-of-least-resistance read, Pinak levels block.
  • Playback engine unchanged (keys: terrain, signals). Old tabs retired; their
    logic lives on inside these two. v1.19 kept as deploy fallback.
v1.19.2 [FIX] Pinak tab, on live 0DTE: three glitches fixed.
  • VOL TRIGGER (flip) showed nonsense (e.g. 4800) — the zero-cross finder grabbed the
    first sign flip in the deep near-zero wings. Now ignores crossings where |GEX| is
    <2% of max and picks the crossing NEAREST spot.
  • K* (parity forward) showed nonsense (e.g. 7320) — parity solver trusted stale/crossed
    deep-ITM quotes. Now restricted to strikes within ±3% of spot with valid two-sided
    quotes (ask>bid), using bid/ask MIDS.
  • Level labels collided/overwrote (CALL WALL+CEILING+K* stacked). Now labels are
    staggered vertically with leader lines when levels sit close together.
v1.19.1 [FIX] Forward-sim field was TIME-FLAT (looked like flat green/red blocks, not
  the smooth fade-and-intensify of the real VS3D chart). Cause: forward_sim_grid clamped
  every time column's T to 'now' (when=max(tau,now)), so gamma never decayed across the
  session. Fix: T=_T_at(exp,tau) across the WHOLE 09:30–16:00 axis, so near-dated gamma
  goes asymptotic toward expiry (verified: ATM gamma grows ~16x open→close; time-var
  ratio 0.00→0.17). This also feeds the Forward-models tab (same function). The blue
  'now' line still marks present; candles still overlay actual price.
v1.19  [NEW 'Pinak 2' tab — VS3D Gradient Chart with normalization/transform controls]
  • Added 7th tab '🌈 Pinak 2 (VS3D gradient)'. Reuses the forward-sim grid (model 2,
    today's live-flow VOL weight) and layers the VS3D handoff's tuning chain on top:
      - Normalization modes: Percentile(default, tunable hi pctile) / Linear / Std Dev / Z-Score
      - Intensity transforms: Arcsinh(default, gain slider) / Square Root / Power Law / Linear
        (these tame the 0DTE asymptotic 'deep green all the time' blowout)
      - γ=0 boundary + ridge/trough contour lines
      - Reverse +/- toggle; Greek selector (Gamma green/red · Charm gold/blue)
    All controls live in a sidebar '🌈 Pinak 2 gradient controls' expander.
  • New helpers: pinak2_normalize(), pinak2_transform(), pinak2_contours().
  • Honest note in-tab: OI-proxy sign gives a clean green/red split, not green-with-
    red-pockets (that needs dealer long/short, which free data lacks) — the split is
    the proxy's tell, not a bug. Caches for playback (1 fig/snapshot).
v1.18  [NEW 'Pinak' tab — dealer-positioning levels, NIFTY-GEX method]
  • Added 6th tab '🎯 Pinak (dealer levels)'. Ports the NIFTY GEX skill's
    methodology onto Barchart 0DTE data, in our price-axis style.
  • GEX per strike = gamma·OI·spot·100 (Barchart gamma). Computes: vol trigger
    (gamma flip = net-GEX zero-cross), call/put walls, ceiling/floor (positive-net-
    GEX ranked by |gex|·OI), upside/downside hedge walls (exp proximity-decay ×
    (1+vanna)), K* (put-call parity forward vs no-arb band), 3 gravity centers,
    pin level + 0-100 confidence score/label, Color exposure (∂γ/∂t).
  • Vanna: TRUE closed-form bs_vanna = -φ(d1)·d2/σ seeded with Barchart IV
    (the skill's #1 upgrade), not the OI×GEX proxy. Also added bs_delta, bs_color.
  • Visual: GEX profile as left-gutter density (green call / red put / gold net) on
    the price axis + candles + all levels as labeled horizontal lines. Signals figure
    below. Uses dispatch/emit so it caches for playback (2 figs/snapshot).
  • Sign remains dealers-short-options CONVENTION (not measured) — noted in-tab.
v1.17.3 Fixed VS3D tab panels rendering at giant full-width size (regression from the
  playback refactor, which emitted each panel full-width). Restored a 2-column grid
  for VS3D in BOTH live and playback so the 6 panels stay a sane size. emit() now
  accepts a container arg to render into a specific column.
v1.17.2 Removed the Cone-tab candle/bar diagnostics expander (was for debugging the
  'candles not drawing' issue, now resolved — just clutter).
v1.17.1 [hotfix] Frame slider crashed when only 1 playback frame existed
  (Streamlit requires slider min<max). Now: <2 frames shows a caption instead of
  the slider, and Play won't start until ≥2 frames are cached. Rest unchanged.
v1.17  [PLAYBACK engine + charm colors + 5-min candles; all tabs refactored]
  • PLAYBACK: every snapshot, all 5 tabs render to PNG and cache in
    session_state.frames[ts][tab]. Sidebar ▶Play/⏸Pause, ⏮Rewind, Speed 1/2/4 s/frame,
    Frame slider. Play advances a frame each fast tick (st_autorefresh at the chosen
    speed); Pause holds so you can read. Playback shows CACHED PNGs — no recompute
    (verified: 22 figs cached live, 22 replayed with 0 recompute). Live 5-min refresh
    is suspended while playing; resumes on pause.
  • All 5 tab bodies refactored into _render_*() funcs called via dispatch(tab,fn),
    which either renders+caches (live) or replays cached frames (playback). emit()
    replaces st.pyplot so every figure is both shown and cached. Nothing removed.
  • Forward-model CHARM recolored to the gold/blue charm_cmap (was red/green); titles
    updated to 'gold=put/− · blue=call/+'.
  • Candles switched to 5-MIN (prep_bars resamples 1-min→5-min OHLC) — less busy;
    candle width auto-adapts to bar spacing.
  • dVOL empty earlier was GENUINE: Barchart volume often unchanged between two 5-min
    snapshots (coarse cache), so Δvol≈0. Not a bug; needs wider spacing to populate.
v1.16  [NEW 'Forward models' tab — VS3D-style price×time forward simulation]
  • Added 5th tab '🔮 Forward models (price×time sim)'. Replicates VS3D's Gradient
    Chart mechanic: each pixel (price P, time-of-day τ) = the greek IF spot were P at
    time τ, from the CURRENT chain, advancing the clock and re-pricing with BS SEEDED
    by each strike's Barchart IV (anchors to real skew, projects forward). Blue 'now'
    line: left held flat (no past re-sim), right = pure forward sim to 16:00. Real
    SPX500 candles overlaid up to now. Charm colored by HEDGING EFFECT (red=sell,
    green=buy) per docs 7.7. All 5 model weightings (naive OI, zero-open VOL, OI+VOL,
    dVOL, vol/OI); dVOL & vol/OI flagged 'forward-sim weak' (defined by past change).
  • New: forward_sim_grid(), _fwd_weight(), _fwd_norm(). Reuses bs_gamma/bs_charm/_T_at
    and the existing candle + time-axis helpers. NO IPython (that was a Colab-only dep;
    deploying the Colab script as the app caused ModuleNotFoundError: IPython).
v1.15  [NEW 'VS3D' TAB — sign-free dashboard ported from Colab; robust auto-refresh]
  • Added a 4th tab '🧭 VS3D (sign-free dashboard)' alongside Cone/Landscape/Surface
    (nothing removed). 6 panels, all computable from FREE Barchart data:
      GAMMA net exposure · |GAMMA| magnitude (walls, sign-free) · SPEED ∂γ/∂spot ·
      CHARM ∂δ/∂t (empirical, w/ flip lines) · COLOR ∂γ/∂t · SIGNALS block
      (straddle range, straddle-decay 'snake-oil' gate, fishbone, gamma absorption,
       skew proxy, VIX regime, timing window).
    Charm/Color/decay populate on the 2nd snapshot (same pattern as Cone charm).
    All panels carry SPX500 candles on the session-time axis (reuses draw_candles).
  • Honest limit shown in-tab: strike-level dealer long/short (anchor vs test),
    net-hedgeable filtering, and OTC flow are NOT replicable without paid data.
  • Auto-refresh hardened: uses streamlit-autorefresh when present; otherwise a
    built-in JS 5-min full-page reload (re-pulls; session_state/snapshots persist),
    replacing the old fragment ticker that didn't re-pull.
  • New analytics (sign-free): vs3d_profiles/_density, vs3d_straddle, vs3d_fishbone,
    vs3d_absorption, vs3d_skew, vs3d_timing, vs3d_vix_regime + mag/speed cmaps.
v1.14  [CONE: real Barchart gamma density + tunable smoothing — still no surface/proj]
  • Cone gamma profile rebuilt as a DENSITY: net signed GEX per strike (Barchart gamma,
    calls+/puts−) interpolated onto the price grid. Smoothing is a SIDEBAR SLIDER
    ("Gradient smoothing", default low) — 0 = raw per-strike detail (bumpy, like vols3d
    live), higher = smoother. Confirmed via vols3d hover tooltip that per-strike
    granularity is desired (bumpy is NOT a bug).
  • Learned from vols3d tooltip: the dashed line is a CONTOUR (zero-boundary of the
    gamma field), not a single "flip" level; the field has multiple real pockets. The
    cone x-axis carries NO time/forecast meaning — width = gamma magnitude per price,
    candles overlaid only for price context. (Corrected my repeated misreading.)
  • Empirical charm profile also rebuilt as interpolated density with same slider.
v1.13  [CONE converted to real Barchart data — surface/projection still pending]
  • Confirmed via Colab: Barchart returns gamma+delta per strike (430/430), but NO charm/
    vanna (only delta,gamma,theta,vega,rho). So gamma is used DIRECTLY; charm is derived
    empirically as Δdelta/Δt from real Barchart deltas across snapshots (user's choice).
  • CONE gamma: net GEX per price level from Barchart per-strike gamma (flat bands, vs3d
    style). NO Black-Scholes. compute_walls also switched to Barchart gamma.
  • CONE charm: empirical Δdelta/Δt vs the previous snapshot; BLANK on the 1st snapshot
    (shows a placeholder), populates once a 2nd snapshot exists. Chain now stores 'delta'.
  • New helpers _gex_profile_barchart() and _empirical_charm_profile(). Verified: gamma
    matches Barchart, charm None on snap1 and populated on snap2.
  • TODO: Landscape (per-strike Barchart gamma projected with T-decay shape, pinned per
    strike + bad-strike clipping) and Intraday surface still use BS internally — next.
v1.12
  • FIX: candles filled the chart to ~16:00 even at 11:56. Cause: tvdatafeed returns
    NAIVE UTC timestamps (verified: last bar 15:56 == UTC now, +3.99h vs EST), but the
    code assumed they were already EST — so every bar was plotted +4h to the right.
  • fetch_bars_raw now localizes timestamps as UTC and converts to EST via zoneinfo
    (DST-aware: −4h summer / −5h winter, never hardcoded), then drops tz.
  • prep_bars now also cuts bars at <= now_est(), so the chart never extends past the
    current minute. Verified with a simulated UTC feed: 13:30 UTC→09:30 EST, series ends at now.
v1.11
  • THE ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE: the symbol was wrong. CAPITALCOM:SPX is a ~68-handle
    instrument (1–3 vol/min) — NOT the index. The real S&P 500 is CAPITALCOM:SPX500
    (~7400, real volume), already on correct scale. Confirmed via live Colab dump.
  • Switched fetch_bars_raw to symbol "SPX500" and REMOVED all scaling/anchoring/window-
    gating from prep_bars. Bars are plotted exactly as returned — no transform. This
    retires the entire v1.2–v1.10 scaling saga, which was chasing a wrong-symbol artifact.
  • Diagnostics (Colab): colab_rth_dump.py (raw RTH dump) + colab_symbol_probe.py.
v1.10
  • Bar handling rewritten to the user's rule (cleaner than the v1.9 threshold):
    anchor CAPITAL.COM bars to the trusted BARCHART SPOT — scale by ratio=spot/feed-median
    (skipped when ratio is 0.98–1.02, i.e. already correct, so a normal day is untouched) —
    then KEEP ONLY bars within ±window_pct of spot (the slider); anything else is ignored.
    Caption/diagnostics report the scale factor and how many bars were dropped.
  • Added colab_bar_diagnostic.py (separate file): standalone Colab cell that pulls the
    REAL CAPITAL.COM bars + REAL Barchart spot and prints the scale/window numbers, so the
    feed's behaviour can be confirmed without fighting Streamlit.
v1.9
  • ROOT CAUSE FOUND (via v1.8 diagnostics): the CAPITAL.COM:SPX feed quotes SPX on a
    DIVIDED scale (~108×, e.g. ~68 instead of ~7400). Candles were being drawn correctly
    but at y≈68, far below the price window, so invisible. (Not contrast, not date/tz.)
  • FIX: prep_bars scales bars by the EXACT ratio spot/bar-level, but ONLY when it's a
    GROSS mismatch (>3× or <1/3×). A normal/trending day (ratio≈1) is left EXACTLY as-is,
    so the old '7429 shown at 7450' inflation cannot recur. Diagnostics shows the factor.
  • Verified: ~108× and ~10× feeds corrected onto spot; normal ~7400 day untouched (out==raw).
v1.8
  • Added a DIAGNOSTICS expander at the bottom of the Cone tab. Shows the bar pipeline
    at every stage: raw feed rows/dtypes/dates/times, prep_bars result, session window
    datenums vs bar datenums, how many bars land INSIDE the x-window (i.e. actually get
    drawn), and price-window coverage. Purpose: stop guessing why candles don't appear —
    read the numbers. If "bars INSIDE session window" = 0, it's a date/tz mismatch, not contrast.
v1.7
  • FIX: candles were being DRAWN (256 of them) but invisible — the old thin 0.3px
    gray outline got swallowed by the saturated gradient. Candles now have a dark halo
    on wicks + a contrasting body outline so they read on top of any gradient color.
    (This was a contrast bug, not a data/filter bug — bars were in-window the whole time.)
v1.6
  • FIX (regression from v1.5): y-axis collapsed to 0–7400 again. Cause: v1.5 window
    math did lo=min(lo, bars['l'].min()) with NO guard, so a single feed bar with a
    near-zero low dragged the whole axis to 0 (gradient invisible, candles flat).
  • Y-axis is now PURELY spot ± window_pct. Bars NEVER influence the axis range, so no
    stray feed value can collapse or inflate it. A junk bar just plots off-screen.
    Tested with an injected low=0.01 bar: axis stays spot±2.5%, gradient spans it.
v1.5
  • Simplified bar handling: CAPITAL.COM:SPX is clean index data, so prep_bars now
    just keeps today's RTH bars (09:30–16:00 EST) and plots them. Removed the spot-band
    filter, median fallback, and numeric-coercion logic from v1.4 that was rejecting
    ALL bars ("all bars outside ±20% of spot"). Window = spot ± window_pct, widened by
    today's RTH range. WHY: the v1.4 safety net over-rejected; the data doesn't need it.
v1.4
  • FIX (regression from v1.3): price y-axis collapsed to 0–7400, gradient invisible,
    candles flat at bottom. Two root causes fixed:
    1) Bar sanity filter judged bars against their OWN median, so a cluster of corrupt
       feed rows dragged the median down and let junk (near-zero lows) survive. Now
       bars are filtered against the KNOWN spot (±20%), which cannot be fooled.
    2) Window math took bars' raw min/max, so one bad low collapsed p_min→~0. Window
       is now ANCHORED to spot (±window_pct), only widened by bars within ±15% of spot,
       with a final check that the range straddles spot and is a sane width.
  WHY v1.3 broke it: removing the spot*0.5 clamp exposed the weak median filter; the
  alignment guard didn't catch it because price/gradient/axis all shared the SAME bad range.
v1.3
  • Removed ALL price rescaling. CAPITAL.COM:SPX is the SPX index 1:1, so candles
    are now drawn exactly as TradingView reports them (prep_bars only drops
    obviously corrupt rows; it never multiplies/shifts a price).
  • Removed every `p_min = max(p_min, spot*0.5)` clamp in the three builders, so the
    price grid (pg) equals the requested window exactly — no hidden range shift.
  • Added an on-chart ALIGNMENT GUARD in _finish(): checks each gradient image's
    y-extent == price grid == axis ylim; if they ever drift it stamps a red
    "⚠ Y-AXIS MISALIGNED — DO NOT TRADE OFF THIS" banner. Verified it stays silent
    when aligned and fires when broken.
  • Added a numeric regression (run offline) across all 3 renderers × tight/normal/
    wide windows confirming price/gradient/axis share one y-scale.
  WHY: a candle high of 7429 was displaying at ~7450 — caused by rescaling bars by
  the session median (inflates on a trending day). Decisions need price ON the true
  gradient level, so every value-altering transform was stripped and guarded.

v1.2
  • First fix attempt for the above: rescale only on a gross (>=2x) mismatch vs the
    latest bar instead of the day's median. (Superseded by v1.3, which removes it
    entirely — the right call since the feed is already 1:1.)

v1.1
  • X-axis hard-locked to RTH 09:30–16:00 EST: set_autoscalex_on(False) + margins(x=0)
    so candle wicks / wall-track plots can no longer re-expand the window. Hourly ticks.
  WHY: the display window kept drifting because plotting bars outside RTH triggered
  matplotlib autoscale after set_xlim.

v1.0
  • Surface projection (right of "now") now uses REAL TIME-DECAY: the current book is
    re-evaluated at shrinking T minute-by-minute to the 0DTE close, so pockets sharpen
    as T→0 (reuses the BS engine; per-option expiry, so multi-expiry decays correctly).
  • Candles pulled FRESH from tvdatafeed every run — caching removed entirely.
  WHY: flat projection "looked like shit"; candles looked stale due to the bars cache.

v0.9
  • Surface projects the CURRENT structure FLAT from now→close (dimmed levels map, no
    decay yet); recorded portion still shows real migration. Filename versioning began.

v0.8
  • Surface tab reworked to "Option A": positioning heatmap over real recorded time
    (first snapshot→now), migrating γ-flip contour + call/put wall migration tracks.
    No projection. WHY: trader view = watch positioning shift vs price reaction.

v0.7
  • Candles switched to 1-minute bars (from 5-min) for tighter price tracking.

v0.6
  • Snapshot scrubber slider: view the book as of any past snapshot; cone/landscape
    redraw to that snapshot, surface trims to snapshots up to the selected time.

v0.5
  • Unified candles + x-axis across all 3 tabs: one draw_candles(), one session_window(),
    one style_time_axis(). Only the gradient math differs per tab now.

v0.4
  • All times pinned to US Eastern via now_est()/today_est() (zoneinfo); tvdatafeed
    bars treated as already-EST. WHY: cloud box runs UTC, distorting T and the bar-date
    filter so today's candles weren't printing.

v0.3
  • Tabbed UI: Cone | Landscape (forward projection) | Intraday surface. Each tab stacks
    all its methods, every chart shows Gamma + Charm.

v0.2
  • Removed TradingView login — no-login CAPITALCOM:SPX works.

v0.1
  • Streamlit POC: in-memory 5-min chain snapshots (st.session_state, no files),
    auto-refresh every 5 min, manual Snapshot/Refresh/Clear.

Notes
-----
• Snapshots are kept ENTIRELY IN MEMORY (st.session_state) — POC, no files.
  They accumulate while the app session is alive and reset if the app restarts
  or sleeps. That's fine for a proof of concept.
• A snapshot of the option chain is taken when one is "due" (≥5 min since the
  last) or when you click "Snapshot now". Auto-refresh re-runs the app every
  5 minutes which triggers a due snapshot.
• Landscape/cone views use the latest snapshot. The "Intraday surface" view
  uses the full snapshot history (so OI+flow / flow-from-open / interval-flow
  actually accumulate over the session).
• Sign = standard dealer convention (calls +, puts −). Volume is unsigned; we
  do not guess buy/sell.
